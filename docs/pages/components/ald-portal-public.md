# Activity Location Data Portal (Public)

**Share Activity Location Data with partners publicly**

---

The Activity Location Data Portal aggregates exact site location data using the [h3 hexagonal grid](https://h3geo.org/) to generalize data for public consumption. Implementing Partners and other stakeholders can identify where USAID is operating and collaborate with others. The Activity Location Data Portal (Public) is a component of the USAID/Guatemala Data Hub. (The Activity Location Data Portal is not currently available).
